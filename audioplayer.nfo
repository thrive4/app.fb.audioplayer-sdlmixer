update v1.2 15/05/2023
- added drc, dynamic range compression can be set via conf.ini

| measure signal level of audio as bass does.
- added toggle drc via key 'd' drc on or off (placeholder for now)
- added toggle listplay via key 'l' shuffle or linear
- added os mixer fader volume control (windows 7 and 10)
| route: sourcevolume > drcvolume (on / off) > currentvolume( is os mixer volume)
| source is set via config, drc amps <n>Db currentvolume is final volume output
- improved command line handling catches incorrect files and paths
- tweaked utilfile.bas more in line with other apps
- tweaked shuffleplay scanning from root dir is not supported
- tieded up code in most files
- use init sdl with SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO) instead of SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)
| SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO) does not block os powerplan to blank display
| note: when using SDL_INIT_AUDIO use SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER, "1")
| respond to power plan settings blank display on windows
| note: set before sdl init (video) otherwise it will not work!
